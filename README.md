# Minecraft Color Code Preview
Preview your text in various Minecraft color codes as well as be able to copy that text as well.

## To-Do
[x] Implement formatting codes (ex. bold, italics, obfuscated, etc.)  
[x] Allow color and formatting together  
[x] Accept usage of MOTD code (ex. `\u00A70` which equates to black)  
[ ] Implement preview of MOTD code as well as maintain raw preview of color codes  
[x] Switch to RegEx for an easier and more efficient method of parsing color codes  
[x] Add "Copy" button to easily copy text from preview boxes  
[ ] Add further styling to the site  
[ ] Maybe add some additional pages?
